This is an AVL tree visualizer written in Java. The project was originally created as part of a university course. 

## Description

AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which maintain a balanced tree height to ensure fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. This visualizer allows users to create, modify, and visualize AVL trees using a graphical interface.
